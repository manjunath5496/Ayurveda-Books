<p>The main classical Ayurveda texts begin with accounts of the transmission of medical knowledge from the Gods to sages, and then to human physicians.&nbsp;In&nbsp;<em><a title="Sushruta Samhita" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta_Samhita">Sushruta Samhita</a></em>&nbsp;(<em>Sushruta's Compendium</em>),&nbsp;<a title="Sushruta" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta">Sushruta</a>&nbsp;wrote that&nbsp;<a title="Dhanvantari" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhanvantari">Dhanvantari</a>,&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Hindu" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu">Hindu</a>&nbsp;god of Ayurveda, incarnated himself as a king of Varanasi and taught medicine to a group of physicians, including Sushruta.&nbsp;Ayurveda therapies have varied and evolved over more than two millennia.&nbsp;Therapies are typically based on complex herbal compounds, minerals and metal substances (perhaps under the influence of early Indian alchemy or&nbsp;<em><a title="Rasa shastra" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasa_shastra">rasa shastra</a></em>). Ancient Ayurveda texts also taught surgical techniques, including&nbsp;<a title="Rhinoplasty" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoplasty">rhinoplasty</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Lithotomy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithotomy">kidney stone extractions</a>, sutures, and the extraction of foreign objects.</p>
<p>Although laboratory experiments suggest it is possible that some substances used in Ayurveda might be developed into effective treatments, there is no scientific evidence that any are effective as currently practiced. Ayurveda medicine is&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Pseudoscientific" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscientific">pseudoscientific</a>.&nbsp;Other researchers consider it a&nbsp;<a title="Protoscience" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoscience">protoscience</a>, or trans-science system instead.&nbsp;In a 2008 study, close to 21% of Ayurveda U.S. and Indian-manufactured patent medicines sold through the Internet were found to contain toxic levels of&nbsp;<a title="Heavy metals" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metals">heavy metals</a>, specifically&nbsp;<a title="Lead" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead">lead</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Mercury (element)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)">mercury</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Arsenic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic">arsenic</a>.&nbsp;The public health implications of such metallic contaminants in India are unknown.</p>
<p>Some scholars assert that Ayurveda originated in prehistoric times,&nbsp;and that some of the concepts of Ayurveda have existed from the time of the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Indus Valley Civilization" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization">Indus Valley Civilization</a>&nbsp;or even earlier.&nbsp;Ayurveda developed significantly during the&nbsp;<a title="Vedic period" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic_period">Vedic period</a>&nbsp;and later some of the non-Vedic systems such as Buddhism and Jainism also developed medical concepts and practices that appear in the classical Ayurveda texts.&nbsp;<em><a title="Dosha" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosha">Doṣa</a></em>&nbsp;balance is emphasized, and suppressing natural urges is considered unhealthy and claimed to lead to illness.&nbsp;Ayurveda treatises describe three elemental&nbsp;<em>doṣas</em>&nbsp;viz.&nbsp;<em>vāta</em>,&nbsp;<em>pitta a</em>nd&nbsp;<em>kapha</em>, and state that equality (Skt.&nbsp;<em>sāmyatva</em>) of the&nbsp;<em>doṣas</em>&nbsp;results in health, while inequality (<em>viṣamatva</em>) results in disease. Ayurveda treatises divide medicine into eight canonical components. Ayurveda practitioners had developed various medicinal preparations and surgical procedures from at least the beginning of the&nbsp;<a title="Common Era" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era">common era</a>.</p>

<h2><span id="Eight_components" class="mw-headline">Eight components</span></h2>
<p>The earliest classical&nbsp;<a title="Sanskrit" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>&nbsp;works on Ayurveda describe medicine as being divided into eight components (Skt.&nbsp;<em>aṅga</em>).&nbsp;This characterization of the physicians' art, "the medicine that has eight components" (Skt.&nbsp;<em>cikitsāyām aṣṭāṅgāyāṃ</em>&nbsp;चिकित्सायामष्टाङ्गायाम्), is first found in the Sanskrit epic the&nbsp;<a title="Mahabharata" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata"><em>Mahābhārata</em></a>, c. 4th century BCE.&nbsp;The components are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Kāyachikitsā</em>: general medicine, medicine of the body</li>
<li><em>Kaumāra-bhṛtya</em>&nbsp;(Pediatrics): Discussions about prenatal and postnatal care of baby and mother, methods of conception; choosing the child's gender, intelligence, and constitution; and childhood diseases and midwifery.</li>
<li><em>Śalyatantra</em>:&nbsp;<a title="History of surgery" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_surgery#India">surgical techniques</a>&nbsp;and the extraction of foreign objects</li>
<li><em>Śhālākyatantra:</em>&nbsp;treatment of ailments affecting ears, eyes, nose, mouth, etc. ("ENT")</li>
<li><em>Bhūtavidyā</em>: pacification of possessing spirits, and the people whose minds are affected by such possession</li>
<li><em><a title="Agada" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agada">Agadatantra</a></em>/<em>Vishagara-vairodh Tantra</em>&nbsp;(Toxicology): It includes subjects about epidemics, toxins in animals, vegetables and minerals. It as well contain keys for recognizing those anomalies and their antidotes.</li>
<li><em>Rasāyantantra</em>:&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Rejuvenation (aging)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejuvenation_(aging)">rejuvenation</a>&nbsp;and tonics for increasing lifespan, intellect and strength</li>
<li><em>Vājīkaraṇatantra</em>:&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Aphrodisiacs" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodisiacs">aphrodisiacs</a>&nbsp;and treatments for increasing the volume and viability of semen and sexual pleasure. It also deals with infertility problems (for those hoping to conceive) and spiritual development (transmutation of sexual energy into spiritual energy).</li>

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="thumb tright">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The word "ayurveda" is&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Sanskrit language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_language">Sanskrit</a>:&nbsp;<span lang="sa"><a class="extiw" title="wikt:आयुर्वेद" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%A6">आयुर्वेद</a></span>,&nbsp;<em lang="sa-Latn" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit transliteration"><em>Āyurveda</em></em>, meaning knowledge of life and longevity.</p>
<p>The central theoretical ideas of Ayurveda developed in the mid-first millennium BCE, and show parallels with&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Sāṅkhya" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C4%81%E1%B9%85khya">Sāṅkhya</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Vaiśeṣika" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vai%C5%9Be%E1%B9%A3ika">Vaiśeṣika</a>&nbsp;philosophies, as well as with&nbsp;<a title="Buddhism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism">Buddhism</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Jainism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism">Jainism</a>.&nbsp;Balance is emphasized, and suppressing natural urges is considered unhealthy and claimed to lead to illness.&nbsp;For example, to suppress sneezing is said to potentially give rise to shoulder pain.&nbsp;However, people are also cautioned to stay within the limits of reasonable balance and measure when following nature's urges.&nbsp;For example, emphasis is placed on moderation of food intake,&nbsp;sleep, and sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>Ayurveda names seven basic tissues (<a class="mw-redirect" title="Dhatu (Ayurveda)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhatu_(Ayurveda)">dhatu</a>), which are plasma (<em>rasa</em>), blood (<em>rakta</em>), muscles (<em>māmsa</em>), fat (<em>meda</em>), bone (<em>asthi</em>),&nbsp;<a title="Bone marrow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow">marrow</a>&nbsp;(<em>majja</em>), and semen (<em>shukra</em>). Like the medicine of classical antiquity, Ayurveda has historically divided bodily substances into five&nbsp;<a title="Classical element" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element#Classical_elements_in_Hinduism">classical elements</a>, (Sanskrit)&nbsp;<em><a class="mw-redirect" title="Panchamahabhuta" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchamahabhuta">panchamahabhuta</a></em>, viz.&nbsp;<a title="Prithvi" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prithvi">earth</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Ap (water)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ap_(water)">water</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Agni" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agni">fire</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Vayu" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vayu">air</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Ether (classical element)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ether_(classical_element)">ether</a>.&nbsp;There are also twenty&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Guna" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guna">gunas</a>&nbsp;(qualities or characteristics) which are considered to be inherent in all matter. These are organized in ten pairs: heavy/light, cold/hot, unctuous/dry, dull/sharp, stable/mobile, soft/hard, non-slimy/slimy, smooth/coarse, minute/gross, and viscous/liquid.</p>
<p>Ama (a&nbsp;<a title="Sanskrit" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>&nbsp;word meaning "uncooked" or "undigested" ) is used to refer to the concept of anything that exists in a state of incomplete transformation. With regards to&nbsp;<a title="Oral hygiene" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene">oral hygiene</a>, it is claimed to be a toxic byproduct generated by improper or incomplete&nbsp;<a title="Digestion" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion">digestion</a>.&nbsp;The concept has no equivalent in&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Standard medicine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_medicine">standard medicine</a>.</p>
<p>Ayurveda also names three elemental bodily humors, the&nbsp;<em>doshas</em>&nbsp;(called Vata, Pitta and Kapha), and states that a balance of the doshas results in health, while imbalance results in disease. One Ayurvedic view is that the doshas are balanced when they are equal to each other, while another view is that each human possesses a unique combination of the doshas which define this person's temperament and characteristics. In either case, it says that each person should modulate their behavior or environment to increase or decrease the doshas and maintain their natural state.</p>
<p>In medieval taxonomies of the Sanskrit knowledge systems, Ayurveda is assigned a place as a subsidiary&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Veda" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veda">Veda</a>&nbsp;(<a class="mw-redirect" title="Upaveda" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upaveda">upaveda</a>).&nbsp;Some medicinal plant names from the&nbsp;<em><a title="Atharvaveda" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atharvaveda">Atharvaveda</a></em>&nbsp;and other Vedas can be found in subsequent Ayurveda literature.&nbsp;The earliest recorded theoretical statements about the canonical models of disease in Ayurveda occur in the earliest&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Buddhist Canon" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_Canon">Buddhist Canon</a>.</p>
<h2><span id="Practice" class="mw-headline">Practice</span></h2>
<p>Ayurvedic doctors regard physical existence, mental existence, and personality as their own units, with each element being able to influence the others.&nbsp;This is a&nbsp;<a title="Holism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism#Medicine">holistic</a>&nbsp;approach used during diagnosis and therapy, and is a fundamental aspect of Ayurveda. Another part of Ayurvedic treatment says that there are channels (<em>srotas</em>) which transport fluids, and that the channels can be opened up by massage treatment using oils and&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Swedana" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedana">Swedana</a>&nbsp;(fomentation). Unhealthy, or blocked, channels are thought to cause disease.</p>
<h3><span id="Diagnosis" class="mw-headline">Diagnosis</span></h3>
<p>Ayurveda has eight ways to diagnose illness, called&nbsp;<a title="Nadi (yoga)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadi_(yoga)">Nadi</a>&nbsp;(pulse), Mootra (urine),&nbsp;<a title="Malas (Ayurveda)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malas_(Ayurveda)">Mala</a>&nbsp;(stool), Jihva (tongue), Shabda (speech), Sparsha (touch), Druk (vision), and Aakruti (appearance). Ayurvedic practitioners approach diagnosis by using the five senses.&nbsp;For example, hearing is used to observe the condition of breathing and speech.&nbsp;The study of the lethal points or&nbsp;<em>marman marma</em>&nbsp;is of special importance.</p>

</div>
<div class="thumb tright">&nbsp;</div>
<h3><span id="Treatment_and_prevention" class="mw-headline">Treatment and prevention</span></h3>
<p>Two of the eight branches of classical Ayurveda deal with surgery (<em>Śalya-cikitsā</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Śālākya-tantra</em>), but contemporary Ayurveda tends to stress attaining vitality by building a healthy&nbsp;<a title="Metabolism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism">metabolic system</a>&nbsp;and maintaining good&nbsp;<a title="Digestion" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion">digestion</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Excretion" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion">excretion</a>.&nbsp;Ayurveda also focuses on exercise,&nbsp;<a title="Yoga" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga">yoga</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Meditation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation">meditation</a>.&nbsp;One type of prescription is a&nbsp;<a title="Sattvic diet" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sattvic_diet">Sattvic diet</a>.</p>
<p>Ayurveda follows the concept of&nbsp;<a title="Dinacharya" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinacharya">Dinacharya</a>, which says that natural cycles (waking, sleeping, working, meditation etc.) are important for health. Hygiene, including regular bathing, cleaning of teeth,&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Tongue scraping" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue_scraping">tongue scraping</a>, skin care, and eye washing, is also a central practice.</p>
<h3><span id="Substances_used" class="mw-headline">Substances used</span></h3>
<p>Plant-based treatments in Ayurveda may be derived from roots, leaves, fruits, bark, or seeds such as&nbsp;<a title="Cardamom" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardamom">cardamom</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Cinnamon" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon">cinnamon</a>. In the 19th century, William Dymock and co-authors summarized hundreds of plant-derived medicines along with the uses, microscopic structure, chemical composition, toxicology, prevalent myths and stories, and relation to commerce in&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="British India" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_India">British India</a>.&nbsp;Animal products used in Ayurveda include milk, bones, and&nbsp;<a title="Gallstone" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallstone">gallstones</a>. In addition, fats are prescribed both for consumption and for external use. Consumption of minerals, including&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Sulphur" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulphur">sulphur</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Arsenic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic">arsenic</a>, lead,&nbsp;<a title="Copper sulfate" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_sulfate">copper sulfate</a>&nbsp;and gold, are also prescribed.&nbsp;The addition of minerals to herbal medicine is called&nbsp;<em><a title="Rasa shastra" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasa_shastra">rasa shastra</a></em>.</p>
<p>Ayurveda uses alcoholic beverages called&nbsp;<em>Madya</em>,&nbsp;which are said to adjust the doshas by increasing Pitta and reducing Vatta and Kapha.&nbsp;Madya are classified by the raw material and fermentation process, and the categories include: sugar-based, fruit-based, cereal-based, cereal-based with herbs, fermentated with vinegar, and tonic wines. The intended outcomes can include causing purgation, improving digestion or taste, creating dryness, or loosening joints. Ayurvedic texts describe Madya as non-viscid and fast-acting, and say that it enters and cleans minute pores in the body.</p>
<p>Purified&nbsp;<a title="Opium" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium">opium</a>&nbsp;is used in eight Ayurvedic preparations&nbsp;and is said to balance the Vata and Kapha doshas and increase the Pitta dosha.&nbsp;It is prescribed for diarrhea and dysentery, for increasing the sexual and muscular ability, and for affecting the brain. The sedative and pain-relieving properties of opium are considered in Ayurveda. The use of opium is found in the ancient Ayurvedic texts, and is first mentioned in the&nbsp;<em>Sarngadhara Samhita</em>&nbsp;(1300-1400 CE), a book on pharmacy used in&nbsp;<a title="Rajasthan" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a>&nbsp;in Western India, as an ingredient of an aphrodisiac to delay male ejaculation.&nbsp;It is possible that opium was brought to India along with or before&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquests_on_the_Indian_subcontinent">Muslim conquests</a>.&nbsp;The book&nbsp;<em>Yoga Ratnakara</em>&nbsp;(1700-1800 CE, unknown author), which is popular in&nbsp;<a title="Maharashtra" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>, uses opium in a herbal-mineral composition prescribed for diarrhea.&nbsp;In the&nbsp;<em>Bhaisajya Ratnavali</em>, opium and camphor are used for acute gastroenteritis. In this drug, the respiratory depressant action of opium is counteracted by the respiratory stimulant property of Camphor.&nbsp;Later books have included the narcotic property for use as analgesic pain reliever.</p>
<p><em><a title="Cannabis indica" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_indica">Cannabis indica</a></em>&nbsp;is also mentioned in the ancient Ayurveda books, and is first mentioned in the&nbsp;<em>Sarngadhara Samhita</em>&nbsp;as a treatment for diarrhea.&nbsp;In the&nbsp;<em>Bhaisajya Ratnavali</em>&nbsp;it is named as an ingredient in an aphrodisiac.</p>
<p>Ayurveda says that both oil and tar can be used to stop bleeding,&nbsp;and that traumatic bleeding can be stopped by four different methods:&nbsp;<a title="Ligature (medicine)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)">ligation</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a title="Blood vessel" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel">blood vessel</a>,&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Cauterisation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauterisation">cauterisation</a>&nbsp;by heat, use of preparations to facilitate&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Blood clot" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_clot">clotting</a>, and use of preparations to&nbsp;<a title="Vasoconstriction" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction">constrict</a>&nbsp;the blood vessels. Oils are also used in a number of ways, including regular consumption, anointing, smearing, head massage, application to affected areas,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Oil pulling" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_pulling">oil pulling</a>. Liquids may also be poured on the patient's forehead, a technique called&nbsp;<a title="Shirodhara" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirodhara">shirodhara</a>.</p>
<div class="thumb tright">&nbsp;</div>
<h3><span id="Panchakarma" class="mw-headline">Panchakarma</span></h3>
<p><span id="Panchakarma"></span>According to Ayurveda, panchakarma are techniques to&nbsp;<a title="Detoxification (alternative medicine)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detoxification_(alternative_medicine)">eliminate toxic elements from the body</a>.</p>
<h2><span id="Current_status" class="mw-headline">Current status</span></h2>
<div class="thumb tleft">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Based on the World Health Assembly resolution on traditional medicine (WHA62.13, compare as well the 2008 Beijing declaration on traditional medicine), the&nbsp;<a title="World Health Organization" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization">WHO</a>&nbsp;has established a traditional medicine strategy, which involves, among other complementary health systems, Ayurveda.&nbsp;The first previous global strategy was published in 2002 and dealt especially with herbal medicines. The current version (2014-2023) is beginning to consider aspects of Traditional and Complementary Medicine practices and practitioners and whether and how they should be integrated into overall health service delivery.&nbsp;It is as well part of the 2013 WHO,&nbsp;<a title="World Intellectual Property Organization" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Intellectual_Property_Organization">WIPO</a>, WTO TRIPS study on health innovation and access to medicines.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a title="World Trade Organization" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization">WTO</a>&nbsp;mentions Ayurveda in its intellectual property strategy. Traditional medicine, including Ayurveda, contributes significantly to the health status of many communities, and is increasingly used within certain communities in developed countries. Traditional medicine has a long history of use in health maintenance and in disease prevention and treatment, particularly for chronic diseases.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<em><a title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2017)">citation needed</span></a></em>]</sup>&nbsp;Suitable recognition of traditional medicine is an important element of national health policies and has a well important basis for new products with significant export potential.&nbsp;WTO, WIPO and WHO ask for respect for both the economic value and the social and cultural significance of traditional knowledge and supports documentation of traditional medical knowledge and enhanced regulation of quality, safety and efficacy of such products. The WHO paper asks to integrate traditional and complementary medicine services, where appropriate, into health care service delivery and self-health care and to promote an improved universal health coverage by doing so.</p>

<p>According to some sources, up to 80 percent of people in India use some form of traditional medicine, a category which includes Ayurveda.</p>
<p>In 1970, the Indian Medical Central Council Act which aimed to standardise qualifications for Ayurveda practitioners and provide accredited institutions for its study and research was passed by the&nbsp;<a title="Parliament of India" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India">Parliament of India</a>.&nbsp;In 1971, the&nbsp;<a title="Central Council of Indian Medicine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Council_of_Indian_Medicine">Central Council of Indian Medicine</a>&nbsp;(CCIM) was established under the Department of Ayurveda,&nbsp;<a title="Yoga" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga">Yoga</a>&nbsp;and Naturopathy, Unani,&nbsp;<a title="Siddha medicine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddha_medicine">Siddha medicine</a>&nbsp;and Homoeopathy (AYUSH),&nbsp;<a title="Ministry of Health and Family Welfare" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_and_Family_Welfare">Ministry of Health and Family Welfare</a>, to monitor higher education in Ayurveda in India.&nbsp;The Indian government supports research and teaching in Ayurveda through many channels at both the national and state levels, and helps institutionalise traditional medicine so that it can be studied in major towns and cities.&nbsp;The state-sponsored&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="AYUSH" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AYUSH">Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences</a>&nbsp;(CCRAS) is designed to do research on Ayurveda.&nbsp;Many clinics in urban and rural areas are run by professionals who qualify from these institutes.&nbsp;As of 2013, India has over 180 training centers offer degrees in traditional Ayurvedic medicine.</p>
<p>To fight&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Biopiracy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopiracy">biopiracy</a>&nbsp;and unethical patents, in 2001 the&nbsp;<a title="Government of India" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India">government of India</a>&nbsp;set up the&nbsp;<a title="Traditional Knowledge Digital Library" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Knowledge_Digital_Library">Traditional Knowledge Digital Library</a>&nbsp;as a repository for formulations of various systems of Indian medicine, such as Ayurveda,&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Unani" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unani">Unani</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Siddha medicine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddha_medicine">Siddha</a>.&nbsp;The formulations come from over 100 traditional Ayurveda books.&nbsp;An&nbsp;<a title="Indian Academy of Sciences" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Academy_of_Sciences">Indian Academy of Sciences</a>&nbsp;document quoting a 2003-04 report states that India had 432,625 registered medical practitioners, 13,925 dispensaries, 2,253 hospitals and a bed strength of 43,803. 209 under-graduate teaching institutions and 16 post-graduate institutions.&nbsp;Insurance companies cover expenses for Ayurvedic treatments in case of conditions such as spinal cord disorders, bone disorder, arthritis and cancer. Such claims constitute 5-10 percent of the country's health insurance claims.</p>

<h3><span id="Other_countries_on_the_Indian_subcontinent" class="mw-headline">Other countries on the Indian subcontinent</span></h3>
<p>About 75%-80% of the population of Nepal use Ayurveda,&nbsp;and it is the most practiced form of medicine in the country.</p>
<div class="thumb tright">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Sri Lankan tradition of Ayurveda is similar to the Indian tradition. Practitioners of Ayurveda in Sri Lanka refer to Sanskrit texts which are common to both countries. However, they do differ in some aspects, particularly in the herbs used.</p>
<p>In 1980, the Sri Lankan government established a Ministry of Indigenous Medicine to revive and regulate Ayurveda.&nbsp;The Institute of Indigenous Medicine (affiliated to the&nbsp;<a title="University of Colombo" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colombo">University of Colombo</a>) offers undergraduate, postgraduate, and MD degrees in Ayurveda Medicine and Surgery, and similar degrees in unani medicine.&nbsp;In the public system, there are currently 62 Ayurvedic hospitals and 208 central dispensaries, which served about 3 million people (about 11% of Sri Lanka's population) in 2010. In total, there are about 20,000 registered practitioners of Ayurveda in the country.</p>
<p>According to the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Mahavamsa" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavamsa">Mahavamsa</a>, an ancient chronicle of&nbsp;<a title="Sinhalese people" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_people">Sinhalese</a>&nbsp;royalty from the sixth century C.E., King&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Pandukabhaya of Sri Lanka" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandukabhaya_of_Sri_Lanka">Pandukabhaya of Sri Lanka</a>&nbsp;(reigned 437 BCE to 367 BCE) had lying-in-homes and Ayurvedic hospitals (Sivikasotthi-Sala) built in various parts of the country. This is the earliest documented evidence available of institutions dedicated specifically to the care of the sick anywhere in the world.&nbsp;<a title="Mihintale" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihintale">Mihintale</a>&nbsp;Hospital is the oldest in the world.</p>
<h3><span id="Outside_the_Indian_subcontinent" class="mw-headline">Outside the Indian subcontinent</span></h3>
<p>Ayurveda is a system of traditional medicine developed during antiquity and the medieval period, and as such is comparable to pre-modern&nbsp;<a title="Traditional Chinese medicine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine">Chinese</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Medieval medicine of Western Europe" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_medicine_of_Western_Europe">European</a>&nbsp;systems of medicine. However, beginning in the 1960s, Ayurveda has been advertised as&nbsp;<a title="Alternative medicine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine">alternative medicine</a>&nbsp;in the Western world. Due to different laws and medical regulations in the rest of the world, the unregulated practice and commercialisation of Ayurveda have raised ethical and legal issues. In some instances, Ayurvedic practices or terminology have also been adapted specifically for Western consumption, notably in the case of "<a title="Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharishi_Vedic_Approach_to_Health">Maharishi Ayurveda</a>" in the 1980s. In some cases, this involved active fraud on the part of proponents of Ayurveda in an attempt to falsely represent the system as equal to the standards of modern&nbsp;<a title="Medical research" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research">medical research</a>.</p>
<p><a title="Baba Hari Dass" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Hari_Dass">Baba Hari Dass</a>&nbsp;was an early proponent who helped bring Ayurveda to the US in the early 1970s. He taught classes derived from the&nbsp;<em>Suśrutha Saṃhitā</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>Charaka Saṃhitha</em>, leading to the establishment of the&nbsp;<a class="new" title="Mount Madonna Institute (page does not exist)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mount_Madonna_Institute&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Mount Madonna Institute</a>, College of Ayurveda, Ayurveda World, and Ayurvedic pharmacy.&nbsp;He invited several notable Ayurvedic teachers, including&nbsp;<a title="Vasant Lad" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasant_Lad">Vasant Lad</a>, Sarita Shrestha, and Ram Harsh Singh. The Ayurvedic practitioner Michael Tierra wrote that "[t]he history of Ayurveda in North America will always owe a debt to the selfless contributions of Baba Hari Dass."</p>
<p>In the United States, the practice of Ayurveda is not licensed or regulated by any state. Practitioners of Ayurveda can be licensed in other healthcare fields such as&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Massage therapy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage_therapy">massage therapy</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="Midwifery" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwifery">midwifery</a>, and a few states have approved schools teaching Ayurveda.</p>
<h2><span id="Classification_and_efficacy" class="mw-headline">Classification and efficacy</span></h2>
<p><span id="Safety"></span>Although laboratory experiments suggest it is possible that some substances in Ayurveda might be developed into effective treatments, there is no evidence that any are effective in themselves. According to&nbsp;<a title="Cancer Research UK" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_Research_UK">Cancer Research UK</a>, no significant scientific evidence has shown effectiveness of Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of any disease, although massage and relaxation are often beneficial for some cancer patients and there are indications from animal studies that some herbal products used in Ayurveda might be explored further.</p>
<p>Today, ayurvedic medicine is considered&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Pseudoscientific" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscientific">pseudoscientific</a>&nbsp;on account of its confusion between reality and metaphysical concepts.&nbsp;Other researchers debate whether it should be considered a&nbsp;<a title="Protoscience" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoscience">protoscience</a>, an unscientific, or trans-science system instead.<sup id="cite_ref-Semple_&amp;_Smyth_88-0" class="reference"></sup></p>
<p>A review of the use of Ayurveda for&nbsp;<a title="Cardiovascular disease" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease">cardiovascular disease</a>&nbsp;concluded that the evidence is not convincing for the use of any Ayurvedic herbal treatment for heart disease or hypertension, but that many herbs used by Ayurvedic practitioners could be appropriate for further research.</p>
<p>Research into ayurveda has been characterized as pseudoscience. Both the lack of scientific soundness in the theoretical foundations of ayurveda and the quality of research have been criticized.</p>
<h3><span id="Research" class="mw-headline">Research</span></h3>
<p>In India, research in Ayurveda is undertaken by the&nbsp;<a title="Ministry of AYUSH" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_AYUSH">Ministry of AYUSH</a>, an abbreviation for the Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy, through a national network of research institutes.</p>
<p>In Nepal, the National Ayurvedic Training and Research Centre (NATRC) researches medicinal herbs in the country.</p>
<p>In Sri Lanka, the&nbsp;<a title="Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health,_Nutrition_and_Indigenous_Medicine">Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine</a>&nbsp;looks after the research in Ayurveda through various national research institutes.</p>
<h4><span id="Use_of_toxic_metals" class="mw-headline">Use of toxic metals</span></h4>
<p>Rasa shastra, the practice of adding metals, minerals or gems to herbal preparations, may include toxic&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Heavy metal (chemistry)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_(chemistry)">heavy metals</a>&nbsp;such as lead,&nbsp;<a title="Mercury (element)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)">mercury</a>&nbsp;and arsenic.&nbsp;The public health implications of metals in rasa shastra in India is unknown.&nbsp;Adverse reactions to herbs are described in traditional Ayurvedic texts, but practitioners are reluctant to admit that herbs could be toxic and that reliable information on herbal toxicity is not readily available. There is a communication gap between practitioners of modern medicine and Ayurveda.</p>
<p>Some traditional Indian herbal medicinal products contain harmful levels of heavy metals, including lead.&nbsp;A 1990 study on Ayurvedic medicines in India found that 41% of the products tested contained arsenic, and that 64% contained lead and mercury.&nbsp;A 2004 study found toxic levels of heavy metals in 20% of Ayurvedic preparations made in South Asia and sold in the Boston area, and concluded that Ayurvedic products posed serious health risks and should be tested for heavy-metal contamination.&nbsp;A 2008 study of more than 230 products found that approximately 20% of remedies (and 40% of&nbsp;<em>rasa shastra</em>&nbsp;medicines) purchased over the Internet from U.S. and Indian suppliers contained lead, mercury or arsenic.&nbsp;A 2015 study of users in the United States found elevated blood lead levels in 40% of those tested, leading physician and former&nbsp;<a title="Flight surgeon" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_surgeon">U.S. Air Force flight surgeon</a>&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Harriet A. Hall" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_A._Hall">Harriet Hall</a>&nbsp;to say that "Ayurveda is basically superstition mixed with a soup&ccedil;on of practical health advice. And it can be dangerous."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heavy metals are thought of as active ingredients by advocates of Indian herbal medicinal products.&nbsp;According to ancient Ayurvedic texts, certain physico-chemical purification processes such as&nbsp;<em><a title="Samskara (ayurvedic)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samskara_(ayurvedic)">samskaras</a></em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em><a title="Shodhana" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shodhana">shodhanas</a></em>&nbsp;(for metals) 'detoxicify' the heavy metals in it.&nbsp;These are similar to the Chinese&nbsp;<em><a class="mw-redirect" title="Pao zhi" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pao_zhi">pao zhi</a></em>, although the Ayurvedic techniques are more complex and may involve physical pharmacy techniques as well as&nbsp;<a title="Mantra" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra">mantras</a>. However, these products have nonetheless caused severe&nbsp;<a title="Lead poisoning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning">lead poisoning</a>&nbsp;and other toxic effects.&nbsp;Between 1978 and 2008, "more than 80 cases of lead poisoning associated with Ayurvedic medicine use [were] reported worldwide".&nbsp;In 2012, the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>&nbsp;(CDC) linked Ayurvedic drugs to lead poisoning, based on cases where toxic materials were found in the blood of pregnant women who had taken Ayurvedic drugs.</p>
<p>Ayurvedic practitioners argue that the toxicity of&nbsp;<a title="Bhasma" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhasma">bhasmas</a>&nbsp;comes from improper manufacturing processes, contaminants, improper use of Ayurvedic medicine, quality of raw materials and that the end products and improper procedures are used by charlatans.</p>
<p>In India, the government ruled that Ayurvedic products must be labelled with their metallic content.&nbsp;However, in&nbsp;<em><a title="Current Science" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_Science">Current Science</a></em>, a publication of the Indian Academy of Sciences, M. S. Valiathan said that "the absence of post-market surveillance and the paucity of test laboratory facilities [in India] make the quality control of Ayurvedic medicines exceedingly difficult at this time".&nbsp;In the United States, most Ayurvedic products are marketed without having been reviewed or approved by the FDA. Since 2007, the FDA has placed an import alert on some Ayurvedic products in order to prevent them from entering the United States. A 2012 toxicological review of mercury-based traditional herbo-metallic preparations concluded that the long-term pharmacotherapeutic and in-depth toxicity studies of these preparations are lacking.</p>
<h2><span id="History" class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>According to modern Ayurvedic sources, the origins of Ayurveda have been traced to around 6,000&nbsp;<a title="Common Era" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era">BCE</a><span style="font-size: xx-small;">&nbsp;</span>when they originated as an oral tradition.&nbsp;Some of the concepts of Ayurveda have existed since the times of&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Indus Valley Civilization" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization">Indus Valley Civilization</a>.&nbsp;The first recorded forms of Ayurveda as medical texts evolved from the Vedas.&nbsp;Ayurveda is a discipline of the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Upaveda" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upaveda">upaveda</a>&nbsp;or "auxiliary knowledge" in Vedic tradition. The origins of Ayurveda are also found in&nbsp;<a title="Atharvaveda" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atharvaveda">Atharvaveda</a>, which contains 114 hymns and incantations described as magical cures for disease. There are various legendary accounts of the origin of Ayurveda, e.g. that it was received by&nbsp;<a title="Dhanvantari" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhanvantari">Dhanvantari</a>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<a title="Divodasa" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divodasa">Divodasa</a>) from&nbsp;<a title="Brahma" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma">Brahma</a>.&nbsp;Tradition also holds that the writings of Ayurveda were influenced by a lost text by the sage&nbsp;<a title="Agnivesa" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnivesa">Agnivesa</a>.</p>
<p>Ayurveda is one of the few systems of medicine developed in ancient times that is still widely practiced in modern times.&nbsp;As such, it is open to the criticism that its conceptual basis is obsolete and that its contemporary practitioners have not taken account of the developments of modern medicine.&nbsp;Responses to this situation led to an impassioned debate in India during the early decades of the twentieth century, between proponents of unchanging tradition (<em>śuddha</em>&nbsp;"pure" ayurveda) and those who thought ayurveda should modernise and syncretize (<em>aśuddha</em>&nbsp;"impure, tainted" ayurveda).&nbsp;The political debate about the place of ayurveda in contemporary India has continued to the present (2015), both in the public arena and in government.&nbsp;Debate about the place of Ayurvedic medicine in the contemporary internationalized world also continues today (2015).</p>
<div class="thumb tright">&nbsp;</div>
<h3><span id="Main_texts" class="mw-headline">Main texts</span></h3>
<p>There are three principal early texts on Ayurveda, the&nbsp;<a title="Charaka Samhita" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charaka_Samhita">Charaka Samhita</a>, the&nbsp;<a title="Sushruta Samhita" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta_Samhita">Sushruta Samhita</a>&nbsp;and the Bhela Samhita. The Sushruta Samhita is based on an original from the 6th century BCE,&nbsp;and was updated by the Buddhist scholar&nbsp;<a title="Nagarjuna" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagarjuna">Nagarjuna</a>&nbsp;in the 2nd century CE.<sup id="cite_ref-128" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayurveda#cite_note-128">[128]</a></sup>&nbsp;The Charaka Samhita, written by&nbsp;<a title="Charaka" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charaka">Charaka</a>, and the Bhela Samhita, attributed to&nbsp;<a title="Atreya" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atreya">Atreya Punarvasu</a>, are also dated to the 6th century BCE.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a title="Charaka Samhita" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charaka_Samhita#Contents">Charaka Samhita</a>&nbsp;was also updated by&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Dridhabala" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dridhabala">Dridhabala</a>&nbsp;during the early centuries of the Common Era.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a title="Bower Manuscript" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bower_Manuscript">Bower Manuscript</a>&nbsp;(dated to the Gupta era, between the 4th and the 6th century CE) includes of excerpts from the Bheda Samhita&nbsp;and its description of concepts in Central Asian Buddhism. In 1987, A. F. R. Hoernle identified the scribe of the medical portions of the manuscript to be a native of India using a northern variant of the Gupta script, who had migrated and become a Buddhist monk in a monastery in Kucha. The Chinese pilgrim&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Fa Hsien" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa_Hsien">Fa Hsien</a>&nbsp;(c. 337&ndash;422 AD) wrote about the healthcare system of the Gupta empire (320&ndash;550) and described the institutional approach of Indian medicine. This is also visible in the works of Charaka, who describes hospitals and how they should be equipped.</p>
<p>Other early texts are the Agnivesha Samhita, Kasyapa Samhita and Harita Samhita. The original edition of the Agnivesha Samhita, by Agnivesa, is dated to 1500 BCE,&nbsp;and it was later modified by Charaka.&nbsp;Kasyapa Samhita includes the treatise of&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Jivaka Kumar Bhaccha" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jivaka_Kumar_Bhaccha">Jivaka Kumar Bhaccha</a>&nbsp;and is dated to the 6th century BCE.&nbsp;While Harita Samhita is dated to an earlier period, it is attributed to&nbsp;<a title="Harita" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harita">Harita</a>, who was a disciple of Punarvasu Atreya.&nbsp;Some later texts are&nbsp;<em>Astanga nighantu</em>&nbsp;(8th Century) by Vagbhata,&nbsp;<em>Paryaya ratnamala</em>&nbsp;(9th century) by Madhava,&nbsp;<em>Siddhasara nighantu</em>&nbsp;(9th century) by Ravi Gupta,&nbsp;<em>Dravyavali&nbsp;</em>(10th Century), and&nbsp;<em>Dravyaguna sangraha</em>&nbsp;(11th century) by&nbsp;<a title="Chakrapani Datta" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakrapani_Datta">Chakrapani Datta</a>, among others.</p>
<h3><span id="Illnesses_portrayed" class="mw-headline">Illnesses portrayed</span></h3>
<p>Underwood and Rhodes state that the early forms of traditional Indian medicine identified fever, cough,&nbsp;<a title="Tuberculosis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis">consumption</a>, diarrhea,&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Dropsy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropsy">dropsy</a>,&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Abscesses" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscesses">abscesses</a>,&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Seizure" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure">seizures</a>, tumours, and&nbsp;<a title="Leprosy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy">leprosy</a>,&nbsp;and that treatments included&nbsp;<a title="Plastic surgery" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery">plastic surgery</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Lithotomy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithotomy">lithotomy</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Tonsillectomy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonsillectomy">tonsillectomy</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Couching (ophthalmology)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couching_(ophthalmology)">couching</a>&nbsp;(a form of cataract surgery), puncturing to release fluids in the&nbsp;<a title="Abdomen" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen">abdomen</a>, extraction of foreign bodies, treatment of&nbsp;<a title="Anal fistula" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_fistula">anal fistulas</a>, treating fractures,&nbsp;<a title="Amputation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation">amputations</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Caesarean section" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section#History">cesarean sections</a>,&nbsp;and stitching of wounds.&nbsp;The use of herbs and surgical instruments became widespread.&nbsp;During this period, treatments were also prescribed for complex ailments, including&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Angina pectoris" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angina_pectoris">angina pectoris</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Diabetes" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes">diabetes</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Hypertension" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension">hypertension</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Calculus (medicine)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_(medicine)">stones</a>.</p>
<h3><span id="Further_development_and_spread" class="mw-headline">Further development and spread</span></h3>
<p>Ayurveda flourished throughout the Indian Middle Ages.&nbsp;<a title="Dalhana" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalhana">Dalhana</a>&nbsp;(fl. 1200), Sarngadhara (fl. 1300) and Bhavamisra (fl. 1500) compiled works on Indian medicine.&nbsp;The medical works of both Sushruta and Charaka were also translated into the Chinese language in the 5th century,&nbsp;and during the 8th century, they were translated into the Arabic and&nbsp;<a title="Persian language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language">Persian</a>&nbsp;language. The 9th-century Persian physician&nbsp;<a title="Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Zakariya_al-Razi">Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi</a>&nbsp;was familiar with the text.&nbsp;The Arabic works derived from the Ayurvedic texts eventually also reached Europe by the 12th century.&nbsp;In&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Renaissance Italy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Italy">Renaissance Italy</a>, the Branca family of Sicily and Gaspare Tagliacozzi (<a title="Bologna" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna">Bologna</a>) were influenced by the Arabic reception of the Sushruta's surgical techniques.</p>
<p>British physicians traveled to India to observe&nbsp;<a title="Rhinoplasty" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoplasty">rhinoplasty</a>&nbsp;being performed using native methods, and reports on Indian rhinoplasty were published in the&nbsp;<em><a class="mw-redirect" title="Gentleman's Magazine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman%27s_Magazine">Gentleman's Magazine</a></em>&nbsp;in 1794.&nbsp;Instruments described in the&nbsp;<em>Sushruta Samhita</em>&nbsp;were further modified in Europe.&nbsp;<a title="Joseph Constantine Carpue" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Constantine_Carpue">Joseph Constantine Carpue</a>&nbsp;studied plastic surgery methods in India for 20 years and, in 1815, was able to perform the first major rhinoplasty surgery in the western world, using the "Indian" method of nose reconstruction.&nbsp;In 1840 Brett published an article about this technique.</p>
<p>During the period of colonial British rule of India, the practice of Ayurveda was neglected by the British Indian Government, in favor of modern medicine. After Indian independence, there was more focus on Ayurveda and other traditional medical systems. Ayurveda became a part of the Indian National health care system, with state hospitals for Ayurveda established across the country. However, the treatments of traditional medicines were not always integrated with others.</p>
